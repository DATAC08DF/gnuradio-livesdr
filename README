Ubuntu Remaster is a set of automated scripts for taking a stock ISO
distribution image from Canonical and recreating it with changes and
additional content.  It is broken up into layered branches to allow
you to make your own optionally encrypted ISO images.  Customizers can
branch off various 'layers' to add their custom content to an existing
image.


Using the Ubuntu Remaster build scripts

To create a remastered Ubuntu ISO file, with no further customization
beyond what is done in these scripts, simply do the following:

$ git clone -b <desired branch> git://github.com/jmcorgan/ubuntu-remaster.git
$ cd ubuntu-remaster
$ make deps
$ make config
$ make

This will require 'sudo' access. Everything is completely automated,
except for passphrase entry when making an encrypted image (see
below), and possible password prompts for 'sudo' operation.

You may edit these three configuration variables (config/config-vars
in the repository):

* REMASTER_SUFFIX=<string> defines the string that will get added to the stock
  image file name.

* UPDATE_PKGS={NO,YES} determines whether the remastering will attempt
  to updated existing packages in the stock image at time of
  remastering.  This may also be required if new packages are to be
  installed.

* ENCRYPTED={NO,YES} determines whether the the created image will be
  encrypted, requiring a passphrase to be entered up bootup.  The
  contents of the image will be decrypted and decompressed on-the-fly
  as needed during operation.  However, the root filesystem on any
  media the image is written to remains encrypted.  You will be
  prompted a total of three times for the passphrase during the
  generation of the encrypted image. The encryption used is based on
  LUKS, which uses PBKDF2 key generation and AES256-ESSIV bulk
  encryption.

There are several branches to choose from, depending on the type of
customization you want to do.

Branch 'master':

This branch creates a remastered ISO image with the bare minimum of
changes from the stock ISO. Branch off this if you want to start from
scratch and make whatever changes you need.  Updates to this branch
will ripple through to all other branches.


Branch 'basic':

This branch is a superset of master and is designed to create a basic
live ISO image with a some important changes:

* Configures apt to use the full list of repositories

* Removes the Ubiquity installer package and provides direct boot up
  into the desktop.  This may become configurable in the future.

* Removes noisy, annoying, high CPU, or privacy reducing packages:

  - Ubuntu Unity 'scopes' that search remotely
  - The 'zeitgeist' package, which tracks desktop activity
  - The 'avahi' package that broadcasts local network info
  - Ubuntu Unity overlay scrollbars

* Updates all other packages on the stock image from Ubuntu
  repositories, at the time of remastering

* Adds desktop indicators for system resource usage and CPU frequency
  selection

* Sets the compiz window manager to 'low graphics' mode to lower CPU
  usage

Branch off here to incorporate the above changes into a baseline for
your own further customization.
